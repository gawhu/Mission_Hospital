                        Mission Hospital Milestones
                        
                        Mission Hospital was established: May 10, 1937
                        Our School of Nursing opened in 1941.
                        The grand opening of Mission Hospital, then known as The Bangkok Sanitarium and Hospital was on March 18, 1951.
                        The School of Medical Technology was launched in 1951
                        Dental department was opened in 1957.</p>

                    <h3>Accreditation</h3>
                    <img src="./image/ab_ac.jpg" alt="Accreditation">
                    <p>Mission Hospital is proud to be one of the first few private hospitals in Thailand to receive Hospital Accreditation (HA). The HA program is a program for quality improvement for both public and private hospitals in Thailand. The fundamentals of this program are patient focus, organizational and multi-disciplinary teamwork and continuous self-assessment and improvement. 

                        The HA program began in 1994 out of the need for a more comprehensive hospital standard. Hospital standards for the US, Canada, Australia and UK were reviewed and the Thai hospital standard was drafted in 1996. Thirty-five hospitals from both private and public sectors joined the HA pilot program in order to create model hospitals, fine tune standards, strengthen the initial team of surveyors, and promote better understanding of the program by the public and healthcare professionals.
                        
                        In 1999, HA-Thailand conducted its first survey on 4 hospitals. The survey process was a combination of the Canadian and the US style. The rating method was based on the European Quality Award. Nine general standards were used – mission and vision, organization, manpower management, education and training, policies and procedures, environment of care, instruments, systems and processes and continuous quality improvement activities and results.
                        
                        The HA-Thailand program, has maintained a high standard. By 2002, fewer than 10 private of 470 private hospitals had received HA accreditation. Mission Hospital is honored in the top five hospitals to receive this accreditation.
                        
                        The HA standards continue to evolve and improve, following the trends in the United States. In 2004, patient safety became a top priority. Hospitals now focus on patient identification, a high-risk medication alert system, correct surgical site, infusion pumps, medical and drug abbreviations, and prevention of hospital-acquired infections.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <img src="./image/ab_history.jpg" alt="History">
                    <p>Mission Hospital first began as Bangkok Mission Clinic, opened in a rented shophouse at 56 Maitrichitr Road near Plabplachai intersection, on May 10, 1937 with funds contributed by a philanthropist sea captain, Thomas Hall. Dr. Ralph Waddell and his wife Ellen, Nai Pleng Vitiamyalaksna, and Pastor Kon Vui-leong directed the development of the original 12-bed hospital with an outpatient department into a 50-bed hospital.

                        As the medical work in Bangkok grew, expanded facilities were needed. In the pre war period, a large house, about a mile from the original clinic was leased and remodeled to provide an additional 30 beds and became known as the Annex. This increased the hospital's capacity to 80 beds and made possible the opening of a school of nursing in May 1941 under the direction of Miss Ruth Munroe.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>World War II and After</h3>
                    <img src="./image/ab_ww2.jpg" alt="ww2">
                    <p>During World War II, the Annex closed and the missionaries left the country, but the clinic continued to operate under the direction of Nai Pleng, a medical assistant, and a Romanian physician, Dr. S. Bene. With the cessation of hostilities, the overseas staff returned to Thailand. On December 25, 1946, the former Annex and surrounding buildings, occupying a six-acre tract of land at the corner of Pitsanuloke and Lan Luang Roads, was purchased for the development of the Bangkok Sanitarium and Hospital. The former Annex, remodeled again, became the initial building of the Bangkok Sanitarium and Hospital. Another building was converted into quarters for the school of nursing which was reopened on July 1, 1946. Thirty-three students of the first post-war class were capped on October 30, 1947. Some of these have been the pillars of the medical work in Thailand.

                        Expansion to the Countryside: Medical activities of the Bangkok Sanitarium & Hospital were extended into the provinces of Thailand in 1949, when the institution sponsored the opening of mission clinics in Ubol, Phuket and Haad Yai, under Drs. J. E. Sandness, F. N. Crider, and R. C. Gregory, respectively. The hospitals in both Haad Yai and Ubol have since been closed.</p>
